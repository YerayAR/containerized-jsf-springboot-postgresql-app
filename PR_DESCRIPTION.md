# Pull Request: Fix compilation errors and enable successful deployment

## 🐛 Problem
The application was failing to build and deploy due to two critical compilation errors:

1. **Backend compilation error**: `DataLoader.java` was trying to use a parameterized constructor for `Product` entity that didn't exist
2. **Frontend compilation error**: `jackson-databind` dependency was missing version specification in `pom.xml`

## 🔧 Solution
### Backend Fix
- **File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/example/backend/Product.java`
- **Change**: Added parameterized constructor to `Product` entity
- **Impact**: Allows `DataLoader` to create product instances with initial data

```java
// Added constructor
public Product(Long id, String name, String description, BigDecimal price, String category, boolean active) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.description = description;
    this.price = price;
    this.category = category;
    this.active = active;
}
```

### Frontend Fix
- **File**: `frontend/pom.xml`
- **Change**: Added version `2.15.2` to `jackson-databind` dependency
- **Impact**: Resolves Maven dependency resolution failure

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.15.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## ✅ Verification
After applying these fixes:
- ✅ Application builds successfully with Docker Compose
- ✅ All containers start and run properly
- ✅ Backend API responds at `http://localhost:8080/api/products`
- ✅ Frontend JSF interface accessible at `http://localhost:8081/app`
- ✅ Database connection established and sample data loaded

## 🚀 Deployment Status
The complete stack is now operational:
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Running on port 5432
- **Spring Boot Backend**: Running on port 8080
- **JSF Frontend**: Running on port 8081

## 📋 Testing
- Backend API returns product data correctly (verified with HTTP requests)
- Frontend displays products in a formatted table
- All services are healthy and communicating properly
